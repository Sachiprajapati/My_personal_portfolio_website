            I'm a last-year Information Technology student. I'm passionate about building websites that 
            combine creativity and functionality. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean, 
            user-friendly designs. With a strong focus on teamwork and collaboration, 
            I work well in group settings and contribute effectively to shared goals. 
            I'm also skilled in documentation, ensuring every project is well-organized and 
            easy to understand.
